Speech Bubble Encouragement: Implement a feature where, whenever the user checks off a task, a speech or thought bubble 
appears near the deer with a short, encouraging message (e.g., “Great job!”, “You’re making progress!”, “Keep going!”).

my workflow: create a floating speech bubble element in newTab.html -> style it in styles.css -> trigger it in newTab.js 
whenever a task is completed (inside your checkbox .addEventListener("change", ...) logic) -> randomly select a positive message

Challenges: initially, the encouragement bubble didn't appear due to a missing HTML element. debugging showed that the 
#encouragement-bubble div wasn't included in the newTab.html. Once added, and after verifying the CSS and JS animation logic, 
the feature worked.

Mood Selection Prompt: Implement a simple mood selection feature(e.g., happy, stressed, neutral) with a small icon or 
emoji. This allows users to log their emotional state quickly each day.
